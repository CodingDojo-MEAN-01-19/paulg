        <h1>Ninjas are dope!</h1>
        <h3>Demon Hanzo</h3>
        <p>Hattori Hanzo was a Samurai who is known as one of the most famous ninjas in Japan’s history. Although not technically a ninja, he utilized very similar techniques and frequently fought alongside them. Hattori was hired by the distinguished Tokugawa family, and later helped Tokugawa Ieyasu become a ruler in Japan. Hattori gained his many famous nicknames, as a “ghost” or “demon” because of his skills, and participation in successful raids. Even the film Kill Bill had to give Hattori a nod.</p>
        <h3>One Powerful Lady</h3>
        <p>Mochizuki Chiyome was one of the most famous female ninjas of her time. So the story goes, she managed to recruit 300 women to form an underground espionage training operation. On the surface, it seemed that Mochizuki was running an orphanage for young women, but she was really training ninjas assassins and spies. Sadly, while we all wish this story is true, the biography that gave this information has been largely discounted as fictionalized—but that hasn’t stopped Chiyome from becoming a pop culture figure, appearing in many video games, films, and other media.</p>
        <h3>All In A Name</h3>
        <p>The word ninja didn’t come into use until the 20th century. The ninjas were typically called Shinobi, meaning covert agent, a word derived from the Japanese “to steal away” or “to hide.”</p>
        <h3>Japanese Robin Hood</h3>
        <p>Ishikawa Goemon was known for robbing the wealthy and giving the fruits of his exploits to the poor. Born in 1558, he was believed to be a ninja apprentice of the Iga clan before becoming a runaway ninja. He was remembered for his “Robin Hood” activities, and was publicly boiled for a failed assassination attempt. Though he does seem to have actually existed, he has become a legendary figure much like Robin Hood, and the stories of his exploits are usually extremely exaggerated.</p>
